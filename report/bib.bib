ABSTRACT={Stimuli from different sensory modalities occurring on or close to the body are integrated in a multisensory representation of the space surrounding the body, i.e., peripersonal space (PPS). PPS dynamically modifies depending on experience, e.g., it extends after using a tool to reach far objects. However, the neural mechanism underlying PPS plasticity after tool use is largely unknown. Here we use a combined computational-behavioral approach to propose and test a possible mechanism accounting for PPS extension. We first present a neural network model simulating audio-tactile representation in the PPS around one hand. Simulation experiments showed that our model reproduced the main property of PPS neurons, i.e., selective multisensory response for stimuli occurring close to the hand. We used the neural network model to simulate the effects of a tool-use training. In terms of sensory inputs, tool use was conceptualized as a concurrent tactile stimulation from the hand, due to holding the tool, and an auditory stimulation from the far space, due to tool-mediated action. Results showed that after exposure to those inputs, PPS neurons responded also to multisensory stimuli far from the hand. The model thus suggests that synchronous pairing of tactile hand stimulation and auditory stimulation from the far space is sufficient to extend PPS, such as after tool-use. Such prediction was confirmed by a behavioral experiment, where we used an audio-tactile interaction paradigm to measure the boundaries of PPS representation. We found that PPS extended after synchronous tactile-hand stimulation and auditory-far stimulation in a group of healthy volunteers. Control experiments both in simulation and behavioral settings showed that the same amount of tactile and auditory inputs administered out of synchrony did not change PPS representation. We conclude by proposing a simple, biological-plausible model to explain plasticity in PPS representation after tool-use, which is supported by computational and behavioral data.}

    abstract = "{An implicit understanding of one’s body with fixed boundaries allows us to differentiate self from other. However, individuals with schizophrenia (SZ) frequently report experiencing bodily self-disturbances such as sudden changes in size and shape of the body and flexible or porous body boundary. In order to quantify bodily disturbances in schizophrenia, we investigated the construct of peripersonal space (PPS), which represents the ‘near’ space immediately surrounding our bodies. Whilst the physical body boundary is fixed, the neural representation of PPS is plastic and can be estimated using multisensory integration paradigms. Moreover, the size and extent of the PPS is thought to be influenced by the social-emotional environment, which in turn has implications for social interactions. We sought to measure PPS in SZ and control participants (CO) by adopting a multisensory integration task in a virtual reality (VR) environment to test whether PPS is altered in SZ when compared to CO. In addition, we examined the effects of social context and threat on the plasticity of PPS.SZ and demographically matched CO participated in a visual-tactile response time (RT) task in immersive VR. Participants wore a head-mounted display and trackers on their feet, hands, and the torso. Handheld controllers were used to deliver tactile vibration and to record RTs. In VR, participants faced either an avatar or a machine that threw a ball at a speed of 3m/s. In addition to this visual display, tactile vibration was delivered to the participant’s hand via the controller at one of five set distance points from the initiation of the ball pitch. Participants were asked to press a trigger on the controller as soon as they felt a vibration. There were two social conditions (ball thrown by a person or a machine) and two emotion conditions (threat versus no threat). The RTs were recorded. According to Serino et al (2018), visuo-tactile integration would facilitate the RT nearer one’s PPS boundary. We calculated the location where the visuotactile facilitation occurs to estimate the boundary of PPS. In addition, we examined positive and negative symptoms, social isolation, and social functioning.PPS boundary in SZ differed significantly from that of the CO. However, there were a range of individual differences in PPS within groups. RTs were faster for threat than non-threat stimuli. The impact of social context was not conclusive.Preliminary results suggest that PPS can be estimated in VR and that PPS is altered in SZ. Given the importance of PPS in the construction of social self, anomalous experience of PPS in SZ may contribute to self-disturbances. Moreover, individual differences in PPS might impact social interactions and hence contribute to social impairments in schizophrenia.}",
